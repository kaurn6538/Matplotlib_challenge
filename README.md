## Pymaceuticals Inc.

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## The following visualizations were created:

## Observations and Insights

Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the tumor size better.

There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, it is 0.84. As the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases too.

The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
